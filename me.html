				<p class="side_text">My name is Raymond, and I like origami! While my main "occupation" is being a student, I still think it would be nice if I could somehow make a living off of origami (I know it's a really unlikely dream). In terms of origami, I've been folding since first grade, and I usually fold other people's designs, ranging from complex designs like Satoshi Kamiya's phoenix to simpler designs like the balls made from Tom Hull's PHiZZ units in the image to the left. I've been working on designing my own origami, but I can only design very basic things so far. Related to that, I've been trying to learn how to fold box-pleated designs from a crease pattern so that I can see how other people design their origami. I'm still not that good designing origami, but I'm hoping to improve over time.</p>
				<p class="side_text">On another note, some other things I do are Rubik's cubes, cello, programming, biking, and crew. I also volunteer and teach computer science classes for  American Chinese School and some other places. I'm trying to get a computer science internship, but it is a little rough.</p>
